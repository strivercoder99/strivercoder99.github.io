# **JEE Rank Predictor**
## **About**
---
### _This code implements a simple linear regression model to predict a student's rank based on their marks. It uses Python's Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries._

### _The data used for training the model is stored in a CSV file called mark_VS_rank.csv. The first column represents the marks obtained by the students, while the second column represents their corresponding ranks._
---

### _To run the project, follow these steps:_


1.)_Ensure that Python and the required libraries (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib) are installed._

2.)_Download the mark_VS_rank.csv file and place it in the same directory as the code file._

3.)_Run the code using the Python interpreter._
